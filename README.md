Fork a repository
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository.
## About forks
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository. For more information, see "Working with forks."

Propose changes to someone else's project
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
